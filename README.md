# hello-world
I'm just getting started with github,doing the tutorial so I dont miss anything useful, its about time I set myself up with an account. Ive been learning python recently and doing a few projects that really could do with proper source control and it would be fun to work in a more community collaborative way, so figured it was time for github for me :)
